# ~~ BSB monorepo editable installer ~~
#  This requirements file is intended for developers
#  who wish to add all the packages in a clone of this repository
#  to a virtual environment of their choosing.
#
# ~~ Usage ~~
#
# It's recommended that you use the `uv` package manager.
# Install it by running the devtools bootstrap helper
# suitable for your platform. e.g. for Linux:
#
# . ./devtools/bootstrap-linux.sh
#
# Next, either activate an existing virtual environment,
# or use `uv venv` to create one.
#
# Finally:
#
# uv pip install -r ./devtools/editable-install.txt
